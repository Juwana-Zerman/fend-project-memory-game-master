# Memory Game Project

The memory game consists of 8 pairs of cards in a deck. The cards are face down and random. The object of the game is for the player to find all 8 matches. The player is timed and the number of moves are counted. Star ratings are calculated as well based on the player's number of moves. A player can challenge themselves to beat the game in less time or go for less moves to receive a higher star rating.

## Game Play

The game begins and the timer starts once the player clicks on the first card.
All cards are face down at the beginning of the game. A turn/move consists of clicking two cards. If the two cards match, the cards stay face up. If the two cards don't match they are flipped back over and the player continues to try and get matches.

When all cards are matched and face up, the player wins the game.
 
## Fun Features

Timer: A timer starts counting when the first card is flipped. 

Moves: Clicking 2 cards is considered a turn/move. A players move count is calculated after each turn.

Rating: There are three stars used to rate the player's performance. A move number below 14 gets the user 3 stars. A move number between 14 and 19 gets the user 2 stars. If it takes 20 or more moves to get all matches the player receives 1 star.

Restart game: A refresh arrow appears above the card deck. Players can start a new game and receive a fresh set of random cards. 

After all matches have been found, the player wins the game. A popup will appear giving the player their game time, number of moves, and star rating.
